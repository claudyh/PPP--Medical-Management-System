*Structure and Features*

The objective of this project is to develop an application for managing a doctor's patients. The application should maintain up-to-date information on all patients, including personal details (name, date of birth, identification card number, phone number, and email) and clinical data records (blood pressure readings, weight, and height) using linked lists. At a minimum, the application should provide an interactive interface to perform the following operations:

1. Add a new patient;
2. Remove an existing patient;
3. List all patients in alphabetical order;
4. List patients with systolic blood pressure above a given threshold (sorted in descending order);
6. Display all information for a specific patient;
7. Record blood pressure, weight, and height for a specific patient on a given date.

In solving this problem, the most suitable data structures should be used. The definition of these structures should be placed in a separate source file. Solutions that are efficient in terms of memory usage will be valued, particularly those that use auxiliary pointer-based structures instead of storing full records in sorting operations. The program should be secure and ensure that all relevant information is stored in text files. These files should be loaded when the program starts and updated as needed to prevent data loss.

*Format*

The text file format for storing patient information is as follows:
- Patient ID
- Name
- Date of birth
- Identification Card number
- Phone number
- Email

The text file format for storing clinical records is as follows:
- Patient ID
- Record date
- Systolic blood pressure
- Diastolic blood pressure
- Weight
- Height

**NOTE:** The development of this project has been completed, with the main operations fully functional. The code includes input validation with appropriate error messages, as well as file storage operations. However, the project may contain some bugs and might lack validation in certain areas. This project was developed as part of a Computer Science course by ClÃ¡udia Torres and Maria JoÃ£o Rosa.
